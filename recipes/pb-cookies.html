        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups creamy peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 cup margarine</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</l>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter, margarine,
                brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. 
                Combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda; 
                stir into the peanut butter mixture. Form dough into walnut 
                sized balls and place them 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie
                sheets. Dip a fork into flour and criss cross each cookie to 
                flatten slightly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until just
                 lightly browned. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 
                 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
